Expect around 20M records in NBBO (so 20K per security)

First millisecond: Just take the first active millisecond
Last millisecond: EOD is 3:35:00.000pm (inclusive of endpoint)

Bonus record should be ONLY unobserved to match with Justin's NBBO file.

time_mroot = (e.g.) 9:30:03
time_mtrail = (e.g) 176 (msec)

SAS can easily grab the last record (e.g.) of time_mroot

hang onto permno (unique id for security). Also sym root & suffix.


BONUS - verify all group values are "3"
